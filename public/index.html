      <h1>BLOG POST 1</h1>
      <p>Hello! My name is Behcet Ozer and I am currently a 5th year at the University of Cincinnati. Im studying
        software engineering, but have recently had advancements in my career that is slowly taking me towards an
        entrepreneurial path. I am trying to get a tech startup off of the ground that focuses on creating a more
        comprehensive menu for restaurants. As an engineer, this shift in my career has forced me to get out of my
        comfort zone. This is my first time taking a class from the college of Lindner and one of my first in person
        classes in a long time. Im excited to absorb all of the knowledge and prior experiences of our instructor, to
        help aide me in my own entrepreneurial journey in the tech world!</p>
