      <h1>BLOG POST 1 - Intro</h1>
      <p>Hello! My name is Behcet Ozer and I am currently a 5th year at the University of Cincinnati. Im studying
        software engineering, but have recently had advancements in my career that is slowly taking me towards an
        entrepreneurial path. I am trying to get a tech startup off of the ground that focuses on creating a more
        comprehensive menu for restaurants. As an engineer, this shift in my career has forced me to get out of my
        comfort zone. This is my first time taking a class from the college of Lindner and one of my first in person
        classes in a long time. Im excited to absorb all of the knowledge and prior experiences of our instructor, to
        help aide me in my own entrepreneurial journey in the tech world!</p>

      <h1>BLOG POST 2 - The Idea That Failed...</h1>
      <p>fairly recently, I was one of the co-founders of a business called, Yummr. the idea of Yummr began when, me and
        my friend
        noticed while dining out - most restaurant menus were incomplete in terms of dietary/nutritional
        information alongside poor visual representations of dishes. We wanted to solve this problem by creating an
        application that provided a comprehensive and interactive menu for the customer using Augmented Reality. We went
        ahead and chugged along for 5 months (01/2022 - 06/2022) creating an MVP for this potential groundbreaking
        product. mid-April, we applied
        to cohort 18 at the 1819 Innovation Hub and got accepted into the program. This facility provided us with the
        necessary mentorship to further dive
        into our idea and probe if we could create a viable business out of it. We went through the 6 week program and
        came up with our problem statement, did customer discovery, created a business model canvas, researched the
        market etc. this all led into the final week in which - we would present our idea infront of potential investors
        and well seasoned entrepreneurs. Although the presentation went great, the idea itself was not really solving
        that big of a problem. We realized that restaurant menus being incomplete was honestly not the end of the world
        for a lot of people. Sure, people would love to see an image or AR model of the dish, but at the end of the day
        -
        who has the time to whip out their phone and scan a QR code; taking them away from the main reason they ate out
        in
        the first place, to for once, not be on that dammed little thing. Although the realization of this has caused us
        to shift perspectives, we are still optimistic about AR and plan to pursue it in different industries besides
        the
        restaurant space. I am still thankful for this amazing oppurtunity as 1819 has taught us how to take an idea,
        throw it into the ringer and see if itll actually become a business.
