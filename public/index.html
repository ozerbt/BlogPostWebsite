      <h1>BLOG POST 1 - Intro</h1>
      <p>Hello! My name is Behcet Ozer and I am currently a 5th year at the University of Cincinnati. Im studying
        software engineering, but have recently had advancements in my career that is slowly taking me towards an
        entrepreneurial path. I am trying to get a tech startup off of the ground that focuses on creating a more
        comprehensive menu for restaurants. As an engineer, this shift in my career has forced me to get out of my
        comfort zone. This is my first time taking a class from the college of Lindner and one of my first in person
        classes in a long time. Im excited to absorb all of the knowledge and prior experiences of our instructor, to
        help aide me in my own entrepreneurial journey in the tech world!</p>

      <h1>BLOG POST 2 - The Idea That Failed...</h1>
      <p>fairly recently, I was one of the co-founders of a business called, Yummr. the idea of Yummr began when, me and
        my friend
        noticed while dining out - most restaurant menus were incomplete in terms of dietary/nutritional
        information alongside poor visual representations of dishes. We wanted to solve this problem by creating an
        application that provided a comprehensive and interactive menu for the customer using Augmented Reality. We went
        ahead and chugged along for 5 months (01/2022 - 06/2022) creating an MVP for this potential groundbreaking
        product. mid-April, we applied
        to cohort 18 at the 1819 Innovation Hub and got accepted into the program. This facility provided us with the
        necessary mentorship to further dive
        into our idea and probe if we could create a viable business out of it. We went through the 6 week program and
        came up with our problem statement, did customer discovery, created a business model canvas, researched the
        market etc. this all led into the final week in which - we would present our idea infront of potential investors
        and well seasoned entrepreneurs. Although the presentation went great, the idea itself was not really solving
        that big of a problem. We realized that restaurant menus being incomplete was honestly not the end of the world
        for a lot of people. Sure, people would love to see an image or AR model of the dish, but at the end of the day
        -
        who has the time to whip out their phone and scan a QR code; taking them away from the main reason they ate out
        in
        the first place, to for once, not be on that dammed little thing. Although the realization of this has caused us
        to shift perspectives, we are still optimistic about AR and plan to pursue it in different industries besides
        the
        restaurant space. I am still thankful for this amazing oppurtunity as 1819 has taught us how to take an idea,
        throw it into the ringer and see if itll actually become a business.
        <br>

      <h1>BLOG POST 4 - Facebook Ad assignment</h1>
      <p>I created a facebook advertisement poster for my business, Yummr. The general point of the advertisement was to
        draw new users onto the site and gauge how many of the impressions converted to actual users. unfortunatly, my
        advertisement has been "in review" for the past 3 days and im not exactly sure why. I set my audience
        demographic to be younger, tech savvy people that happen to be foodies. I currently do not have any data on link
        clicks, leads, reach etc. as the advertisement is still in review. I may try and create a new advertisement if
        the problem still persists by the end of the day. The poster itself is extremely eye catching as its a giant red
        stop sign with the words "this is an ad, visit Yummr.io". My assumption is that people are psychologically
        trained to stop at a stop sign or anything that is red, so they will stop and take the time to visit the link
        out
        of pure curiosity. Hopefully facebook will finally be done with the "in review" stage of things so I can test my
        hypothesis and see what happens with a $5-10 budget.
        <br>
        <br>
        Here is the ad...

      <h1>BLOG POST 5 - What I Have Learned</h1>
      <p>This class was extremely informative yet enjoyable at the same time. I believe this is a hard mixture to
        successfully integrate, yet when it is done correctly, it can become one of the greatest classes an undergrad
        can take. This class is just that - the perfect mixture. I have not been able to make it to class for the past
        couple of weeks because of my full time job and current living situation but, the times I was able to make it
        ive learned that to become a successful entrepreneur, one has to have grit, an undying fury to succeed in
        changing the lives of not their own but the others around them. Yes I learned about the business model canvas
        and all the different monetization schemes of a digital business, but the one thing that stuck out to me was
        once again, to never give up because the second you do give up on your dream or business is the second it will
        fail. Applying the principle of not quitting is easier said then done, but hopefully throughout the rest of my
        time in college and out there in the "real world" (its not all that different from the fake one) I can seriously
        apply the advice of having grit and building the mental fortitude necessary to deal with lifes struggles.
